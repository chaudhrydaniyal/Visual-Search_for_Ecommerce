<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

  

Imagine, you see the image of jacket you never knew you wanted. You turn to your phone to see if you can find it on online clothing stores, but what to type? How to describe this jacket? So many questions and so many vague search terms come to mind when trying to guess the exact search terms to find it. 

This app solves the above issue. It takes images instead of keywords to perform online searches. Rather than having to ask the shopper to accurately describe the item theyâ€™re seeking, the App scans an image the shopper provides, then returns a selection of visually similar items available on top Ecommerce sites like Amazon, Daraz.pk, etc.
